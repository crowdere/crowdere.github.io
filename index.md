## What We Do

**Security Tool Configuration & Tuning**
We help you get the most out of the security tools you already own. From SIEM tuning and log source onboarding to endpoint agent rollouts, we make sure your stack is actually doing what it's supposed to.

**MDR Deployment & Onboarding**
We've guided organizations through full MDR deployments — scoping, agent rollout, integration with your existing environment, and handoff to your operations team. We make the transition smooth so you're not left figuring it out alone.

**Detection Engineering**
Custom detection content tailored to your environment. We build and tune alert logic so your team spends less time chasing false positives and more time on what matters.

**Post-Incident Recovery Support**
If you've been hit with ransomware or a breach, we can help you get back on your feet — rebuilding, hardening, and making sure it doesn't happen again.

## Right-Size Teaming

Every organization is different. Instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all engagement model, we build a team around your specific needs by drawing from our extensive professional network of trusted security practitioners. Whether you need one person for a week or a small team for a quarter, we scale to fit, which can reduce total project cost — not the other way around.
